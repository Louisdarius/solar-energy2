          <h1>Energy the source of our life</h1>
          <p>
            Environmental issues of today are mainly caused by our production
            and the amount of carbon dioxide we emit everyday (consumption of
            energy)- whether that is driving cars, manufacturing goods or simply
            boiling a kettle. Our energy use impacts the earth’s natural systems
            in ways we may not be aware of, so it is essential that we become
            energy efficient and switch to low-carbon fuels in order to lower
            emission. My project is about solving environmental issues caused by
            non-renewable resources of energy, by using a sustainable energy
            source; such as solar panel. However, it is important to understand
            the important of energy in our life and its consuming costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Energy is essential to life and all living organisms. It is central
            to human activity for preparing food, warming homes, powering
            travel, and producing goods. It also enhances and support health in
            many ways. One of the most important sources of energy is the sun.
            The energy of the sun is the original source of most of the energy
            found on earth. We get solar heat energy from the sun, and sunlight
            can also be used to produce electricity from solar cells.

          <h1>Growing population</h1>
          <img

          <p>
            Global demand for energy is rapidly increasing, due to population
            and economic growth, especially in large emerging countries.
            Availability of energy allows populations to grow. Growing
            populations consume more energy, the more energy consumed, the more
            carbon dioxide we emit into the air and the bigger the impact on the
            environment.

          <h1>The Cost of Energy</h1>
          <p>
            As the population grows so is the energy costs. The energy being
            indispensable, its production and consuming costs should be easily
            accessible and affordable but that’s not the case. Energy suppliers
            compete on price and service to win customers. In setting their
            prices, suppliers will seek to cover their costs and to make a
            profit. There are many factors that causes the increase of energy
            prices such as:

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <h4>Market forces</h4>
              <p>
                The wholesale price of gas par example to go up, which then
                means energy customers/consumers are charged a higher bill.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h4>Limited supply</h4>
              <p>
                Limitation in supply is also another factor. Gas is pumped out
                of the ground and electricity is mostly generated using a mix of
                fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. These are all-natural
                supplies, which are costly to get hold of, and more importantly,
                in limited supply.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h4>Global conflicts</h4>
              <p>
                Wars in oil-rich countries and conflicts between countries over
                gas pipelines can impact wholesale prices. For example,
                wholesale gas prices in the UK have spiked when supplies in
                Ukraine, Iraq and Syria have been threatened in recent years.

          <p>
            An increasing number of households are choosing to install solar
            panels on their home to help reduce their energy costs. By using the
            power that you’ve generated on your own roof, you can save hundreds
            each year and become less reliant on the power grid. More widely,
            solar power is also a great sustainable, green energy choice. Solar
            energy doesn’t only help reduce your electricity bills; it also has
            huge benefits for our planet such as: using less water, reducing air
            pollution, help to slow climate change, reducing your household’s
            carbon footprint and Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.
