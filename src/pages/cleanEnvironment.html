          <p>
            Productivity is often explained as being a measure of efficiency in
            converting inputs to useful outputs. While this is true and is the
            basis for success, there are a number of factors that constantly
            hinder any form of productivity or simply reduce the level of
            productivity. A few are; temperature changes, building lighting,
            inadequate equipment and cleanliness of the work environment.
            Acknowledging the gravity of each of these factors, cleanliness is
            highlighted as having a huge tell on productivity. Here you will
            learn how it affects your work environment, but first, it is

            A clean environment is one that is void of any

              >form of pollution</a
            >
            and its effect. Hence it could be an environment that has clean air,
            clean water, and clean energy. Basically, it is a healthy and safe
            environment. Very commonly a clean environment is also considered as
            one that is tidy. This is achieved by implementing proper
            housekeeping methods. Having someone clean, sweep, mop, and clear
            clutter help in ensuring tidiness. While there are human factors
            that contribute to making our environments unclean, there are also a
            number of natural factors we battle against that make our
            environments unclean and unsafe for us.

          <h3>Effects of Clean Environments on Productivity</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Health benefits –</b> There is a direct relationship with
            workplace cleanliness and employee health. This is true because the
            chances of sickness and
            <a href="pollutionEnvironmentalDiseases.html" class="pollutionLink"
              >environmental disease</a
            >
            are reduced. Invariably workers will spend less time away from work.
            Less time is spent on sick leave. Another health effect a clean
            environment has is a reduced stress level. Clutter in the homes and
            offices psychologically make you feel overwhelmed. Clutter will also
            make it hard to locate things. This increases anxiety and reduces
            the time you spend actually working. Increased stress makes your
            life more complicated and is a causative factor of drug abuse,
            fatigue, insomnia, and depression. All of which can be avoided by
            maintaining a clean environment. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Improves focus –</b> Everyday you will be faced with a decent
            amount of tasks. They could be high-level office demands or even
            basic things like preparing breakfast. A well-organized space makes
            you maintain focus on the task at hand. A clean environment will
            imply you will find documents and work tools needed for completing
            your daily tasks. You will avoid frustration when less time is spent
            searching for things, it helps you maintain focus for longer periods
            of time on tasks. It is easy to get distracted talking about untidy
            desks in the office rather than spend that time actually working.
            This has a ripple effect of dragging more and more people into a
            discussion of untidiness and taken bits off time to be spent
            working. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Prolonged lifespan of equipment and appliances –</b> It is easy
            to overlook this as a hinder to your productivity either at work or
            at home, but it is. A big culprit in reducing the lifespan of
            appliances is water. In locations where there is a high percentage
            of hard water, plumbing and every appliance that has to use water
            require more maintenance. Due to the residue that hard water leaves
            on surfaces, more time will be spent cleaning. This is valuable time
            that could be spent on other productive tasks. Hense while reducing
            the lifespan of these appliances it also reduces the man-hour put in
            other tasks. Luckily a quick fix is switching hard water for the
            less toxic soft water. While it will come at a cost, the benefits
            make this a small price to pay. It is, however, safe to go for the
            best water softeners available. This water softener reviews here
            will come in very handy. Higher quality business standards – As they
            say, first impressions last. Visitors in your homes and offices
            evaluate you initially on the bases of your surroundings. This
            assessment comes even before they understand what you do and its
            benefits. Having a clean pollution free environment means they
            immediately are inclined to take you seriously. This directly
            increases the prospects of maintaining a relationship with them. It
            also has an effect on your employees, who believe they are working
            for a good cause if they work in an environment that is clean and
            well organized.
