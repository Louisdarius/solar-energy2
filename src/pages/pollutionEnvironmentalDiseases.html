          <p>
            Pollution is mainly caused by human activities such as industrial
            emissions, poor disposal of wastes, mining, deforestation, use of
            fossil fuels and agricultural activities. Pollution can affect the
            air, the land and human health throughout the world.

          <h3>POLLUTION</h3>
          <p>
            There are various types of pollution i.e. air, water, land, noise,
            industrial, soil, light, thermal etc. and they are categorized based
            on the region of the environment which they negatively impact,
            contributing to the multiple causes of pollution. Accordingly, each
            and every type of pollution has its own distinguishing causes and
            environmental effects. Understanding pollution and its various
            causes can help address the various concerns linked to environmental
            degradation and destruction, and the dangers it brings to human
            health. <br />
            Pollution is of many kinds, but the commonly known are air, land,
            and water pollution. Below are the different types of pollution and
            their distinctive comprehensive explanations.
          </p>

              Air is the most polluted environmental resource. It is the
              introduction of harmful substances in the air that results in
              detrimental impacts to the environmental and humanity. Air
              pollution reduces air quality by making it unclean or
              contaminated. It occurs when harmful substances such as foreign
              gases, odours, dust, or fumes are released in the air at levels
              that can harm the comfort or health of animals and humans, or even
              destroy plant life. Air pollution results from both human and
              natural activities. It is caused by emissions from manufacturing
              industries and power plants, vehicular emissions, smoking, natural
              events such as volcanic eruptions and wildfire, and burning of
              waste materials such as wood, rubber and plastics. The common air
              pollutants include hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds
              (VOCs), dust particles, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides,
              particulate matter, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and nitrogen
              oxides.

              Water pollution is the act of contaminating water bodies namely
              rivers, oceans, lakes, streams, aquifers, and groundwater. It
              occurs when foreign harmful materials like chemicals, waste
              matter, or contaminated substances are directly or indirectly
              discharged into water bodies. Any alterations in the chemical,
              physical, or biological water properties qualify as water
              pollution. Very often, the primary contributors to water pollution
              are human activities since they introduce substances that
              contaminate the water with harmful chemicals and toxic materials.
              Water pollution is categorized into point source, non-point
              source, and groundwater. Point source water pollution occurs when
              the contaminants enter a water body from a single identifiable
              source while non-point source occurs as a result of cumulative
              effects of different amounts of contaminants. Groundwater
              pollution occurs through infiltration and affects groundwater
              sources such as wells or aquifers. Water is the considered the
              second most polluted environmental resource after air pollution.
              <br />
              The causes of water pollution include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The discharge of industrial waste in water bodies</li>
              <li>
                Discharge and dumping of waste materials and home made products
                such as plastics and detergents into water bodies
              </li>
              <li>Oil spills</li>
              <li>
                Natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes that lead to
                intermixing of water with dangerous substances on the land
              </li>
              <li>Sediments from soil erosion</li>

            <h3>Land Pollution</h3>
            <p>

              Land pollution is the destruction or decline in quality of the
              earth’s land surfaces in term of use, landscape and ability to
              support life forms. Many times, it is directly and indirectly
              caused by human activities and abuse of land resources. Land
              pollution takes place when waste and garbage is not disposed off
              in the right manner and as such, introduces toxins and chemicals
              on land. It also occurs when people dump chemical products to
              soils in the form of herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides, or any
              other form of the consumer by-products. Mineral exploitation
              equally leads to the decline in quality of the earth’s land
              surfaces. In this regard, it has grave consequences for human
              health, plant life, and soil quality. Acid rain, construction
              sites, solid waste, mineral exploitation, agricultural chemicals,
              and deforestations are the primary causes of land pollution.

            <h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
            <p>
              <img
                src="../assets/images/pollution/noisePollution.jpg"

              />
              Noise pollution is mostly an undesirable sound or sound which
              generates horrible discomfort on the ears. It is measured in
              decibels (dB) and sound levels beyond 100 dB can cause permanent
              hearing loss. The industrial sound limit according to the World
              Health Organization (WHO) is 75 dB. In the contemporary society,
              noise has become a permanent aspect owing to the daily activities
              such as transportation including airports, traffic and railroads,
              industrial manufacturing, construction works, and concerts. <br />
              In contrast to the other types of pollution, noise pollution lacks
              the element of accumulation in the environment. It merely occurs
              when sounds waves of intense pressure reach the human ears and may
              even affect the body muscles due to sound vibrations. Noise
              pollution similarly affects marine and wildlife animals in the
              same manner it affects humans, and can even cause their death.

              Industrial pollution is the release of wastes and pollutants
              generated by industrial activities into the natural environment
              including air, water, and land. The pollutants and wastes from
              industries encompass air emissions, deposit of used water into
              water resources, landfill disposal, and injection of toxic
              materials underground. <br />
              Industrial pollution can adversely damage plants, kill animals,
              cause ecosystem imbalance, and degrade the quality of life.
              Leading industries such as power plants, steel mills, sewage
              treatment plants, heating plants, and glass smelting among other
              production, processing and manufacturing companies are the
              contributors to industrial pollution. <br />
              They release smoke, effluents, material wastes, toxic byproducts,
              contaminated residues, and chemical consumer products that
              eventually end up in the environment thereby causing pollution.

                Some human are sensitive to one or more allergens. They sneeze,
                their noses run and their eyes itch from pollen, dust and other
                substances. Some suffer sudden attacks that leave them
                breathless and gasping for air. This is allergic asthma. <br />
                Asthma attack often occurs after periods of heavy exercise or
                during sudden changes in the weather. Some can be triggered by
                pollutants and other chemicals in the air and in the home.

                Sometimes, when pregnant women are exposed to chemicals or drink
                a lot of alcohol, harmful substances reach the foetus. Some of
                these babies are born with an organ, tissue or body part that
                has not developed in a normal way. Aspirin and cigarette smoking
                can also cause birth problems. Birth defects are the leading
                cause of death for infants during the first year of life.

                Cancer occurs when a cell or group of cells begins to multiply
                more rapidly than normal. As the cancer cells spread, they
                affect nearby organs and tissues in the body. Eventually, the
                organs are not able to perform their normal functions. Some
                cancers are caused by substances in the environment: cigarette
                smoke, asbestos, radiation, natural and manmade chemicals,
                alcohol, and sunlight.

                role. While most chemicals that enter the body are broken down
                into harmless substances by the liver, some are converted into
                particles called free radicals that can react with proteins in
                the blood to form fatty deposits called plaques, which can clog
                blood vessels. A blockage can cut off the flow of blood to the
                heart, causing a heart attack.

                and behavior. The nervous system consists of billions of nerve
                cells. They carry messages and instructions from the brain and
                spinal cord to other parts of the body. When these cells are
                damaged by toxic chemicals, injury or disease, this information
                system breaks down. Straints and bike helmets can prevent

                Our eyes are especially sensitive to the environment. Gases
                found in polluted air can irritate the eyes and produce a
                burning sensation. Tiny particles from smoke and soot can also
                cause redness and itching of the eyes. Airborne organisms like
                molds and fungus can cause infections of the eyes and eyelids.
                Too much exposure to the sun’s rays can eventually produce a
                clouding of the lens called a cataract.
