              <h3>WHY ARE SOLAR PANELS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?</h3>

              <p>
                Solar panels are the leading source of renewable energy for our
                homes and businesses, with more and more buildings opting to
                have them installed. Alongside this, we are also seeing an
                increase in the number of solar farms that are being
                constructed, all of which means good news for our planet and the
                environment. However, it is important to understand why solar
                panels are good for the environment, as well as a few of the
                issues they may currently produce and how we can fix that.

          <h3>The Benefits for the Environment</h3>
          <p>
            Solar panels have several benefits for the environment due to their
            green energy and lack of emissions when running.
          </p>

          <h4> Cuts down the energy you use from the Grid</h4>
          <p>
            Of course, solar power doesn’t work at night, so for those who
              don’t have solar batteries installed, they still need to be
              connected to the National Grid if they don’t have enough energy to
              run the home after dark. However, it is still massively reducing
              their dependence on the National Grid.
          </p>

          <h4>No emissions</h4>
          <p>
              As solar energy relies entirely on gathering energy from the sun
              and converting it into electricity (or hot water) for use in our
              home, using it means that you are not producing any greenhouse
              gases or contributing to global warming. It can reduce the carbon
              footprint of your home by 80% in one year.
            </p>
            <h4>It’s renewable</h4>
            <p>
              Solar energy is a form of renewable energy. This means that there
              is plenty of it to go around because it is an energy source that
              won’t run out (not for another few billion years anyway). Fossil
              fuels are a finite source of energy, and one that we damage the
              planet with when we mine and distribute it. By relying on solar
              panels, you are one less household that is relying on fossil
              fuels, and it can make a bigger impact than you might think.
            </p>

            <h4>They last a long time and require little to no maintenance</h4> 
            <p>
              The manufacturing process for solar panels is not perfect,
              something that we will look at further in the next section, but
              the fact that they last so long and don’t need much maintenance is
              good news. Conventional heating methods require relatively regular
              replacement and maintenance, which can cause a lot of
              environmentally unfriendly waste, as well as increase the need for
              more units to be made. Solar panels last about 50 years, so you
              shouldn’t need to replace them for a long time.
            </p>
            <h4>Reduces Air Pollution</h4>
             <p>
              Fossil fuels create a lot of pollutants. We’re not even talking
              about carbon dioxide and climate change. If you’ve ever been to
              California, New York, China, or anyplace whose geography consists
              of mountains and valleys, you’ve seen what dirty air looks like.
              Smog is bad for the environment, it’s bad for our health, and it’s
              bad for aesthetics. When pollutants get trapped in the air,
              everything just looks worse. Solar panels help get rid of air
              pollution. Sure, a truck has to deliver the solar energy system to
              your house, but after that, your solar panels create clean energy
              that won’t contribute to air pollution.
            </p>
            <h4>Reduce Water Usage</h4>
            <p>
              If your energy source doesn’t use fossil fuels to power itself, it
              probably uses some sort of water. Hydropower and nuclear energy
              both use a lot of water to produce electricity. But that means
              that water can’t be used for something else. With dams, there’s
              the additional problem that damming water will have a significant
              impact on the local ecosystem. Solar panels create energy without
              water. In fact, the US Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable
              Energy believes that solar energy could help drop water
              consumption in at least 36 states. This would help solve our water
              scarcity issue.
            </p>

            <h4>Reduces Dependence On Nonrenewable Energy Sources</h4>
            <p>
              We already mentioned how some people enjoy solar energy because
              they like being energy independent. But solar can also help reduce
              our dependency on nonrenewable sources of energy in general. This
              is great for so many reasons. First and foremost, those
              nonrenewable energy resources create a lot of the pollutants that
              are in our air. Second, nonrenewable resources are nonrenewable
              because they will, eventually, run out. The sooner and more fully
              we can make the transition to renewable energy, the better for
              both the Earth and our species.
            </p>

            <h4>Improves Humanity’s Health In The Long-run</h4>
            <p>
              we’ve already mentioned how the US Office of Energy Efficiency &
              Renewable Energy believes that solar energy can help us reduce
              water scarcity, but in that same report, the office also estimates
              that cleaner air could have a positive effect on mankind’s health.
              In fact, they estimate that we could save more than 25,000 lives.
              That’s because with cleaner air comes cleaner lungs.
            </p>

            <h4>Helps Fight Climate Change</h4> 
            <p>
              Last but not least, there’s the issue of climate change. As we
              continue to dump pollutants and additional CO2 into the air, our
              planet will continue having a harder and harder time cleaning the
              air. As the carbon count continues to increase, so will our
              retention of heat from the sun. These changing air conditions will
              continue to have an effect on different climates, causing some to
              warm, others to cool, and causing weather patterns everywhere to
              become more sudden and volatile.
            </p>
          <p>
            Scientists and climatologists have created a large enough body of
            work, which includes experiments, climate models, and research, that
            there is now a general consensus that we need to do something to
            stem the tide of climate change. <br />
            Solar is one of the ways we can try to prevent the effects of
            climate change. By reducing our CO2 emissions, and releasing fewer
            pollutants in the air, we can all do our part to slow down climate
            change.

          <h3>The Disadvantages for the Environment</h3>
          <p>
            There are a few disadvantages for the environment that come with
            using solar panels, however. These are important issues to note so
            that they can be addressed with further research and development.
          </p>

          <h4>They can take up a lot of land</h4>
          <p>
              Solar farms are incredibly large structures, and ones that take up
              entire fields. Unlike wind farms, they cannot be shared with
              agricultural pursuits because they are mounted on the ground.
              However, it is possible to try and minimise the impact that solar
              farms have by placing them on brownfield sites, or investing in
              floating solar panels for reservoirs.
            </p>
            <h4>The use of water is a little high</h4>
           <p>
              During the manufacturing process for solar PV panels, water is
              used. This is not a significant amount for concern, however.
              Instead, the focus shifts to thermal solar panels. Concentrating
              solar thermal plants require large quantities of water for the
              cooling systems that have been installed. Unfortunately, many of
              the areas in the world with the highest potential for solar
              efficiency also have some of the driest climates, making this a
              difficult obstacle to overcome.
            </p>
            <h4>The manufacturing process isn’t entirely clean</h4>
             <p>
              The disappointing part of solar panels is the fact that the
              manufacturing process does cause some pollution as well as
              produces hazardous materials. Monocrystalline solar cells produce
              a lot of silicon waste and use additional energy, while thin film
              solar cells contain toxic materials that can cause environmental
              harm. However, most manufacturers are responsible for the safe
              disposal of this waste, and more companies are following suit.
