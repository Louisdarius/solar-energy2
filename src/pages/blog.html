          <p>
           
            Solar power is power that is generated from the sun – from solar
            energy. If you’re looking at installing solar panels on your roof,
            you might be wondering how solar power actually works. There are two
            ways you can harness the energy of the sun: light and heat <br />
            To generate electricity from the sun’s light, we have to take
            advantage of a phenomenon called the photovoltaic effect. <br />
            <b>The photovoltaic effect</b> is where sunlight knocks electrons
            loose in certain materials (such as silicon crystals). With
            prolonged exposure to sunlight, these loose electrons start to flow
            in a circuit. The energy from these moving electrons can be captured
            and turned into electricity. <br />
          </p>

          <section id="hiddenPart1">
            <p>
              <b
                >Solar panels use the photovoltaic (PV) effect to generate
                electricity from sunlight.</b
              >
              <br />
              When sunlight hits the PV cells in your solar panels, electrons
              are knocked loose and start to move around in a closed circuit.
              This is electricity, in its basic form: the electrons flowing
              around a circuit in a solar PV panel generate a form of energy
              called <b>Direct Current</b> (DC) electricity. This low voltage DC
              electricity is then converted into high voltage
              <b>Alternating Current</b> (AC) electricity by an inverter (or
              inverters) connected to your solar PV panels. This AC electricity
              can then be used in your home immediately during the day or stored
              in a solar battery for use at night. A common
              <b>misconception is that solar PV panels use the sun’s heat</b> to
              generate electricity. Conversely,
              <b
                >too much heat can actually reduce the efficiency of your solar
                panels.</b
              >
              The perfect conditions for solar panels are a mild, sunny day of
              about 25 degrees Celsius. The number of solar panels you have, or
              the size of your solar power system, will also dictate how much
              electricity you can generate for your home. Solar systems are
              sized in kilowatts, and each kilowatt of your system will generate
              between 3 and 5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy per day. Generally,
              about 3 or 4 solar PV panels make up 1 kilowatt.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are numerous advantages of using solar power for your
              electricity needs. Solar energy benefits not only the health of
              the planet but can also help you reduce your energy costs in the
              long term.

          <h3>How does solar save you money?</h3>
          <p class="blogInfo"> <span class="author">Steward Hill</span> on <span class="date">05 Jan 2020</span></p>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            <b
              >If you have solar panels on your home, you’ll be generating your
              own electricity to use in your home – for free.</b
            >
            <br />
            This not only reduces the load on the electricity grid but reduces
            your ongoing electricity costs for the lifetime of your solar
            system. <br />
            During the summer months, while you’re on holiday from work or
            school, your energy consumption patterns can also change. <br />
          </p>
          <section id="hiddenPart2">
            <p>
              Where you usually may have normally used most of your electricity
              in the morning or at night, you now might find your home using
              more energy during the day and into the early evening to keep the
              house cooler, run the pool pump more often, or with the TV or
              computer going more than usual to keep the kids entertained. This
              all adds up – especially if you’re pulling power from the grid.
              However, with solar panels, you can power your appliances, air
              conditioner and your pool pump with clean, green, free solar
              power. <br />
              The summer months are full of long, hot days, with an average
              sunset time in Adelaide of just after 8pm. In summer, your solar
              panels will not only generate electricity to cool your home during
              the day, but thanks to the extended sunlight hours, your panels
              will also keep working into the early evening. This all adds up to
              great savings on your electricity bill, at a time when your energy
              usage is often high. <br />
              The benefits of going solar are more than just environmental: they
              can <b>create real, tangible savings</b> for your household
              running costs.

          <h3>How Much Do Solar Panels Cost?</h3>
          <p class="blogInfo"> <span class="author">Rodriguez Dawn</span> on <span class="date">18 Jan 2020</span></p>
          <img
            src="../assets/images/blogs/blog3@unsplash.jpg"

            class="blogImg"
          />
          <p>
            Solar panel cost varies depending on size and type of the system.
            Solar tiles are generally more expensive than the traditional
            panels. The prices, though, have been falling in recent years, due
            to the advancements in solar energy technology. In the table below
            you can see the average prices of solar panel systems, as well as,
            the estimated cost and return. As noted before, this is just an
            attempt to make a broad estimate, since the cost of solar panels
            will differ according to quality, type, and size. The average
            household needs a 4kW solar system. That solar panel cost will range
            <b
              >from £4000 to £6000 and will cover around 21 square metres of
              your roof.</b
            >
            The more electricity your system can generate, the higher the
            initial installation cost, but the savings will also be higher in
            the long term.

              It is safe to say that the installation cost of solar panels isn't
              inexpensive. Nevertheless, there are many solar panel facts that
              prove that solar energy is a great asset for any house. It is an
              asset that after a certain period starts returning money of your
              investment.

          <h3>HOW MUCH DOES A SOLAR BATTERY COST?</h3>
          <p class="blogInfo"> <span class="author">Kelly Smith</span> on <span class="date">20 Feb 2020</span></p>
          <img
            src="../assets/images/blogs/blog4@unsplash.jpg"
            alt="solar panel"
            class="blogImg"
          />
          <p>
            Solar battery storage systems can cost anywhere between $8K and $15K
            including installation, depending on the battery’s capacity, brand,
            functionality, and your ability to access Government incentives or
            rebates. <br />
            While this can seem like a high initial outlay, it’s important to
            consider all the benefits that a solar battery could provide before
            you make a decision. <br />
            With a battery storage system, you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>maximise the use of your own solar energy system;</li>
            <li>
              run more of your appliances off your own energy, day and night;
            </li>
            <li>be greener and cleaner in your household’s energy use;</li>
            <li>
              reduce the impact of future electricity price increases on your
              household running costs; and
            </li>
            <li>depending on your system setup, have power in a blackout.</li>
          </ul>
          <section id="hiddenPart4">
            <h5>What is the payback period for battery storage?</h5>
            <p>
              The payback period on battery storage is longer than just a solar
              system alone. For a newly installed complete solar energy and
              battery storage system, you could expect a payback of between
              <b>5-10 years.</b> <br />
              If you’ve already got solar panels and you’re looking at
              installing a battery as an addition, your payback period will be
              longer. This is because the work to deliver a short payback period
              is actually done by your solar panels, not the battery itself. You
              can, however, still expect all the other benefits that come from
              battery storage, like extra protection from rising grid
              electricity costs, making the most of your solar energy, and
              having power in a blackout. <br />
              If you’re not convinced that battery storage is worth the
              investment right now, it’s still worth ensuring you install a
              solar energy system that is big enough to support a battery for
              when you are ready. The cost to go a bit larger on your solar
              system now to make sure you have enough excess energy to feed a
              battery can be quite small, and you’ll be making sure adding a
              battery, later on, is a simple process.
            </p>

            <h5>
              Are solar batteries just for people who want to go off-grid?
            </h5>
            <p>
              <b
                >No – batteries aren’t just for people who want to go completely
                off-grid.</b
              >
              There are some great advantages of having battery storage attached
              to your solar power system, while still being connected to the
              power grid. Going off-grid is often not a suitable or financially
              viable option for most Australian households, as you would need
              multiple batteries, a back-up generator and complex rewiring. A
              grid-connected or hybrid solar and battery system is often all you
              need to take advantage of solar battery storage and save thousands
              on your electricity bills while helping to stabilise the grid and
              reduce your household’s carbon footprint.
            </p>

            <h5>So, are batteries for solar worth it?</h5>
            <p>
              The long term benefits of generating your own solar power and
              using this <b>24/7,</b>
              instead of drawing from the grid, make battery storage well worth
              the upfront costs. With a home battery, you can not only start
              saving even more money on your power costs long-term, but you’ll
              help to stabilise the energy grid by reducing the load on the grid
              at peak times. Your battery will be charged with your free
              solar-generated power, ready to supply your home with electricity
              day and night – even in a blackout. Your home energy usage will be
              cleaner and greener, and you’ll be doing your bit to support a
              more sustainable energy future.

          <p>
            The size of your solar power system, and therefore the number of
            solar panels you need, should be informed by your electricity usage
            patterns and what you want to achieve. Solar system sizes are
            measured in kilowatts and, depending on where you are and which
            direction your roof faces, each kilowatt of your solar panel system
            will produce between 3 and 5 kWh of clean, renewable energy per day.
            Typically, around 3 to 4 solar panels are needed to make up 1
            kilowatt. When it comes to buying your new solar system, don’t make
            the mistake of thinking ‘one size fits all’.

                  energy use” figure on each of them – it will typically be
                  shown on the first or second page of the bill, and in
                  kilowatt-hours or “kWh”. Note this number down for each bill
                  you have, and then take an average of all of those numbers.
                  The final number you arrive at will be your typical energy use
                  over a 24 hour period, including both day and nighttime hours.
                  Once you have this figure, load it into our simple solar
                  calculator along with a little more information about you and
                  your goals, and in seconds you’ll be able to see how many
                  solar panels you might need.

                <h5>Sunshine hours</h5>
                <p>
                  Solar panels need sunlight to function – it’s an obvious rule.
                  But what buyers often don’t realise is that their home’s
                  exposure to sunlight, or how many sunshine hours they get, can
                  have a direct impact on the number of solar panels they will
                  need.

              <li>
                <h5>Your energy goals</h5>
                <p>
                  The size of the solar energy system you need will also depend
                  on how much you’re aiming to save on your future electricity
                  bills. Do you want to just cover your daytime energy needs, or
                  do you want to add a battery to make yourself almost
                  completely self-sufficient? Have a clear goal in mind about
                  how much of your energy requirements you’d like to have
                  generated by your new solar energy system, and share this goal
                  with your solar energy system designer.

          <h3>HOW TO CLEAN SOLAR PANELS</h3>
          <p class="blogInfo"> <span class="author">Samuel Payet</span> on <span class="date">12 March 2020</span></p>
          <img

            alt="solar panel"
            class="blogImg"
          />
          <p>
            Clean solar panels are efficient solar panels. Your new solar system
            requires very little maintenance, but a clean solar panel is much
            more efficient than a dirty or dusty one. <br />
            Your solar power system’s output may be reduced if your panels are
            covered in dust, dirt or grime. This blocks the sunlight out and
            reduces its efficiency. To get the full cost-saving benefit of solar
            power, it’s best to keep your panels relatively clean and free of
            debris. <br />
          </p>
          <section id="hiddenPart6">
            Dust, dirt, pollen, bird droppings and leaves can all take their
            toll on the performance of your solar system. A regular cleaning can
            do wonders to improve its efficiency. Often, natural rainfall will
            wash away particles of dust or dirt, but you may still need to give
            it a helping hand with your garden hose. <br />
            Step-by-step guide to cleaning solar panels.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h5>Shut down your system entirely.</h5>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Your system should be completely shut down before cleaning as
                  per the shutdown procedure listed in your user manual or your
                  inverter manufacturer’s operating manual. DC Systems will need
                  to be completely shut down. AC Systems should be shut down via
                  the Solar Supply Main Switch.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>
                  Disconnect or block off any rainwater collections or gutters.
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Where rainwater tanks are installed and connected to your
                  guttering system, have them temporarily disconnected or shut
                  off from the gutters to ensure no run-off of dirty water goes
                  into your tank.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Choose a cool, mild time of day.</h5>
                <p>
                  The combination of hot glass on your panels and cool water can
                  increase the chance of cracks from a sudden change in
                  temperature
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Clean your panels from the ground if possible.</h5>
                <p>
                  For safety reasons, it’s wise to clean your panels from the
                  ground if possible. Use a hose to direct water onto your
                  panels. Use a hose with a suitable nozzle to allow the stream
                  of water to reach the panels.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>
                  Make sure that you only direct water onto the top of your
                  solar panels.
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Whilst it is ok for some water to touch the back of your
                  panels, you should not intentionally direct water onto the
                  back of your panels or into the gap between your panels and
                  your roof.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>For stubborn grime, use a soft cloth and mild soap.</h5>
                <p>
                  You don’t need to invest in any fancy cleaning solutions: just
                  water and a mild soap will do the job. A good quality soft
                  brush and squeegee with a plastic blade on one side and a
                  cloth-covered sponge on the other, coupled with a long
                  extension, can make for the perfect tool – and keep you safely
                  on the ground.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>
                  Don’t attempt to climb on your roof without appropriate safety
                  equipment.
                </h5>
                <p>
                  The risk of working on your roof is increased by using water.
                  A roof can become quite slippery when water is used for
                  cleaning. If cleaning your panels from the ground is not
                  possible, do not attempt to access your rooftop unless you
                  have the appropriate safety equipment and training. For your
                  safety, it’s best to hire a suitably qualified professional
                  cleaner instead.
                </p>

          <h3>The Most Common Mistakes When Buying Solar</h3>
          <p class="blogInfo"> <span class="author">Daniel Herms</span> on <span class="date">11 April 2020</span></p>
          <img
            src="../assets/images/blogs/blog7@unsplash.jpg"
            alt="solar panel"
            class="blogImg"
          />

          <h5>
            Thinking a cheap system will perform just as well as a premium
            solution
          </h5>
          <p>
            With the proliferation of solar panels across Australia, it’s easy
            to think that all solar companies are the same, and that it’s
            smartest to just go with the cheapest system you can get. Agreeing
            to the cheapest quote you can get may lead you to big problems later
            on, and it’s typically those very same systems that come with little
            to no after-sales support. Often, cheap solar systems are more
            expensive in the long run than paying in the first place for a
            premium system from a premium provider. With cheap solar panels, you
            often get what you pay for; low quality or poorly installed panels,
            faulty inverters, a system that doesn’t deliver on its promises, and
            terrible or no after-sales customer service or support. While a
            premium solution might be a bigger investment at the start, it will
            pay dividends in great energy savings, long-term performance and
            ongoing after-sales support.
          </p>

          <section id="hiddenPart7">
            <h5>Thinking ‘one size fits all</h5>
            <p>
              Just like a suit or a pair of shoes, a solar system should fit you
              and your energy needs perfectly. Your solar energy solution should
              be sized carefully according to your current energy usage, the
              days and times that you most commonly use energy, your
              expectations and goals for reducing your energy bills or your
              reliance on the grid, and your plans for the future; will your
              family be getting bigger or smaller, or will you want to add a
              battery later? The consultant you are speaking to should be able
              to not only listen to your answers to these questions, but also
              quickly and easily explain how they have taken your future plans
              into consideration in their recommendation. If a salesperson is
              promising a ‘one size fits all’ approach, cannot explain how their
              system is matched to your needs,
              <i>
                or, even worse, doesn’t ask for that sort of information at all,
                hang up the phone immediately and try another company.</i
              >
            </p>

            <h5>
              Not considering the level of after-sales support you’ll receive
            </h5>
            <p>
              Ongoing customer support is critical when it comes to
              understanding and operating your solar panels at their maximum
              efficiency. Whilst this is important for many larger purchases,
              <i>
                it is critical for solar energy solutions; you are investing in
                a product that should have a lifespan in the decades</i
              >
              and has often been selected on the basis of the years of energy
              savings it can provide. After-sales service and customer support
              is actually one of the most common areas where cheaper providers
              cut costs. You might think you’ve found a bargain system with
              low-cost installation, but you could end up losing thousands of
              dollars more in the long-term in repairs, system maintenance and
              inefficient performance. When choosing your solar energy provider,
              make sure you look for a company that offers ongoing customer
              support for the life of your system. Ask them where their support
              team is based and what sort of support they can provide. An
              Australian-based customer service centre and a commitment to
              customer success will make your renewable energy journey easy.
              Your system might cost a little more than overseas, budget
              providers, but it’s a valuable investment that can actually save
              you money down the track.
            </p>

            <h5>Failing to future-proof your system</h5>
            <p>
              With a big investment like solar, you want to make sure you’ve
              considered any future needs or wants. Most solar energy systems
              can be connected to battery storage systems, but there are still a
              few extra things you need to consider before making that final
              decision. If you are planning on adding a battery now or later,
              you may need to add some more solar panels to make sure you can
              generate energy for the evenings as well as your daytime needs. If
              that is the case, can the company you are talking to explain how
              your solar system might need to change or be expanded when you are
              ready for that battery? Might it be more cost-effective to
              actually add the extra solar panels now so you are ready for the
              battery when the time is right? Ask your supplier if your system
              has been designed or laid out on your roof in a way that considers
              how it might need to be modified should the need arise. Shopping
              for your new solar energy system shouldn’t be frustrating,
              time-consuming or confusing. There are many companies out there
              that offer systems for incredibly cheap prices, misleading
              consumers into signing up for a deal that will fail too soon and
              cost them huge amounts in the long term. By staying vigilant,
              asking the right questions and keeping your future goals in mind,
              you can navigate through the search and find your perfect solar
              match.
